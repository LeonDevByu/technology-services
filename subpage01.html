                    <p> The information domain of a problem must be mastered, which includes data outside
                        the software (end users, other systems or external devices), data leaving the system
                        (via the user interface, network interfaces, reports, graphs and other media) and data
                        stores that collect and organize persistent data objects (i.e., those that are retained
                        permanently).</p>

                    <p> The result of the requirements analysis with the customer is captured in the ERS document
                        (system requirements specification), the structure of which may be defined by various standards,
                        such as CMMI. Likewise, an entity/relationship diagram is defined, in which the main entities
                        that will participate in the software development are shown.</p>

                    <p> The software architect is the person who adds value to the business processes thanks to his
                        valuable contribution of technological solutions. System architecture, in general, is a
                        planning activity, either at the network and hardware infrastructure level, or at the
                        software level. The main thing at this point is to clarify the logical and physical aspects
                        of the outputs, organization models and data representation, inputs and processes that make
                        up the system, considering the strengths and limitations of the available resources in meeting
                        the specifications provided for analysis.</p>

                    <h3 class="n-service"><span class="number">4</span>Programming</h3>
                    <p> Implementing a design in code may be the most obvious part of the software engineering work,
                        but it is not necessarily the most labor-intensive or the most complicated. The complexity
                        and duration of this stage is closely related to the programming language(s) used, as well as
                        to the design previously done. </p>
                </div>
                <div class="service">
                    <h3 class="n-service"><span class="number">5</span>Software testing</h3>
                    <p> It consists of verifying that the software correctly performs the tasks indicated in the
                        problem specification. One technique is to test separately each software module (unit testing),
                        and then to test it integrally (integration testing), in order to reach the objective. It is
                        considered a good practice that the tests are carried out by someone other than the developer
                        who programmed it, ideally a testing area; notwithstanding the above, the programmer should do
                        his own tests. </p>

                <div class="service">
                    <h3 class="n-service"><span class="number">6</span>Documentation</h3>
                    <p> It is everything concerning the documentation of the software development itself and of the
                        project management, including modeling (UML), use case diagrams, tests, user manuals, technical
                        manuals, etc; all with the purpose of eventual corrections, usability, future maintenance and
                        system extensions. </p>
